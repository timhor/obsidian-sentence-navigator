This [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin lets you manipulate sentences as a unit of movement. Select, move and delete by whole sentences. Credit for the [original idea](https://github.com/timhor/obsidian-editor-shortcuts/issues/3) goes to [@seatrout](https://github.com/seatrout).

| Command                           | Shortcut \*                    |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Delete to start of sentence       | `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Backspace` |
| Delete to end of sentence         | `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Delete`    |
| Move to start of current sentence | Not set                        |
| Move to start of next sentence    | Not set                        |
| Select current sentence           | Not set                        |
| Select to start of sentence       | Not set                        |
| Select to end of sentence         | Not set                        |

\* On macOS, replace `Ctrl` with `Cmd`

### Important notes
